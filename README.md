# A Simple Stats Viewer

## Synopsis
This program is a baseball stats viewer. It was built as a final project for object-oriented programing 2 at Southwest Tech. I had 15 hours to build the project. 
Currently, only 2022 MLB stats are supported. Users can search for players by name, or via dropdown boxes which filter by team. Users can also display stat leaders for many different hitting and pitching stats. Users can filter by league, team, and by minimum innings pitched for plate appearances. The leader lists can also be reversed to show the worst players.

## Motivation
Apart from demonstrating what I learned in OOP2, I love baseball! I enjoy digging into the stats, and I enjoy spending time on websites such as Baseball Reference and Baseball Savant. I wanted to try my hand at building a simplified version of these sites.

## How to Run
The program is simple to run once the user is all set up. To get set up, the program needs the stats .csv files and the logos .png files (both included in the repo). Once the program can locate the files, the program is self-explanatory, guiding users though labels explaining how to run.

## Tests
I have included a JUnit class which tests the value returning methods in the Utility class. I used JUnit4 to test.

## Contributors
I wrote all the code myself, but the logos were pulled from capsinfo.com and the csv files were pulled from a Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/vivovinco.
